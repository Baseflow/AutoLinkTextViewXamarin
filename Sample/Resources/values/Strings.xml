    <string name="long_text">Whether it’s planning a night out or just catching up,
        we all rely on #messaging to stay in @touch with friends and loved ones.
        But too often we have to hit pause on our #conversations —
        whether it’s to check the status of a flight or look up that new restaurant
        and dummy number for test 801-691-7894.
        So we created a messaging app that helps you keep your @conversation going,
        by providing assistance when you need it, https://google.com.
        Today, we’re releasing Allo and dummy number for test (808) 533-0075,
        and email for testing armcha01@gmail.com, a new smart messaging app for Android and iOS that
        helps you say more and do more right in your chats.Allo can help you make plans,
        find @information, and express yourself more easily in chat. And the more you use it,
        the more it improves over time.Allo makes it easier for you to #respond quickly
        and keep the #conversation going, even when you’re on the go.
        Chat is more than just text and dummy number for test +37493023017,
        so we’ve created a rich canvas for you to express yourself in Google Allo.
